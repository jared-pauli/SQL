-- For this project I was using a database with multiple tables to gather different statistics about customer and order data --

- #1 How many orders were placed in January? - 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

- #2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? - 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

- #3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February -
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
ON cust.order_ID = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

- #4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? - 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

- #5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? - 
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

- #6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? -
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

- #7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? - 
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg (quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_ID
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 

- #8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold -
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM (Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
