-- For this project I was querying a large set of data with 11 different tables -- 

-- This data relates to a fictional digital media store that contains information about artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers --

-- I used a multitude of different commands to answer a wide range of questions about and gain a lot of information from this set of data -- 

-- Thank you for viewing :) -- 

-- #1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US -- 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- #2 Show only the Customers from Brazil --
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- #3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country --
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

-- #4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents -- 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- #5 Create a list of addresses for orders from North America -- 
SELECT BillingAddress, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE BillingCountry IN('USA', 'Canada');

-- #6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name -- 
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.CustomerId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingAddress, i.BillingCity, i.BillingCountry, i.BillingPostalCode, i.Total
FROM chinook.invoices as i 
INNER JOIN chinook.customers as c 
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

LEFT JOIN chinook.employees as e 
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

-- #7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers --
SELECT c.FirstName as customer_FirstName, c.LastName as customer_LastName, e.FirstName as employee_FirstName, e.LastName as employee_LastName, i.Total, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as i 
INNER JOIN chinook.customers as c 
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

LEFT JOIN chinook.employees as e 
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

-- #8 How many Invoices were there in 2009? -- 
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

-- #9 What is the most common Media Type? -- 
SELECT MediaTypeId, COUNT(MediaTypeId)
FROM chinook.tracks
GROUP BY MediaTypeId
ORDER BY Count(MediaTypeId) desc
LIMIT 1;

-- #10 What are the total sales for 2009? -- 
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

-- #11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID -- 
SELECT t.Name, it.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks as t 
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoice_items as it 
ON t.TrackId = it.TrackId
WHERE it.InvoiceLineId <> 'NULL';

-- #12 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID -- 
SELECT a.Name as ArtistName, t.Name as TrackName, it.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items as it
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks as t 
ON it.TrackId = t.TrackId

INNER JOIN chinook.albums as al
ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId

LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as a 
ON al.ArtistId = a.ArtistId;

-- #13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent --
SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 1), e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices as i 
INNER JOIN chinook.customers as c 
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

LEFT JOIN chinook.employees as e 
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
GROUP BY e.FirstName;

-- #14 Create a list of the Top 5 Countries by Order Volume -- 
SELECT BillingCountry, COUNT(BillingCountry) as OrderVolume
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY OrderVolume desc
LIMIT 5;

-- #15 Who is the Oldest Employee? --
